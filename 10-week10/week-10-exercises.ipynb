    "A useful way to understand gradient descent is to start with a known error function.  Imagine that we have a quadratic error function such as $f(x) = x^2$.  The gradient of this error function is just the first derivative of the function $f(x)$.  Using this, finish the following code to calculate the gradient.  After you've done that, try manipulating the learning rate.  What happens?  How many iterations are needed to reach the minimum?"

The neurons in the first hidden layer have learned simple patterns, while the neurons in the second hidden layer have learned to combine the simple patterns of the first hidden layer into more complex patterns. In general, the more layers there are, the more complex the patterns can be.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Activation functions. Try replacing the tanh activation function with a ReLU activation function, and train the network again. Notice that it finds a solution even faster, but this time the boundaries are linear. This is due to the shape of the ReLU function.\n",
    "   - The risk of local minima. Modify the network architecture to have just one hidden layer with three neurons. Train it multiple times (to reset the network weights, click the Reset button next to the Play button). Notice that the training time varies a lot, and sometimes it even gets stuck in a local minimum.\n",
    "   - What happens when neural nets are too small? Remove one neuron to keep just two. Notice that the neural network is now incapable of finding a good solution, even if you try multiple times. The model has too few parameters and systematically underfits the training set.\n",
    "   - What happens when neural nets are large enough? Set the number of neurons to eight, and train the network several times. Notice that it is now consistently fast and never gets stuck. This highlights an important finding in neural network theory: large neural networks rarely get stuck in local minima, and even when they do these local optima are often almost as good as the global optimum. However, they can still get stuck on long plateaus for a long time.\n",
    "   - The risk of vanishing gradients in deep networks. Select the spiral dataset (the bottom-right dataset under “DATA”), and change the network architecture to have four hidden layers with eight neurons each. Notice that training takes much longer and often gets stuck on plateaus for long periods of time. Also notice that the neurons in the highest layers (on the right) tend to evolve faster than the neurons in the lowest layers (on the left). This problem, called the vanishing gradients problem, can be alleviated with better weight initialization and other techniques, better optimizers (such as AdaGrad or Adam), or batch normalization.
